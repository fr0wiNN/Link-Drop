// This service should be responsible for generating urls for shared files and managing them in the database
// it should also record, to what user does this url belongs to. 
// There should be a method for accessing the url by giving the file name. 
// There should be a method for listing all urls made by a person
// 
// Unsecure version:
// plain text url path:
// /storage/:username/:filename
// anyone can access it by bruteforcing filenames 
// 
// Secure version:
// implement url generation, so the path is in gibberish and impossible to guess
